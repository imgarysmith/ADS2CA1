My head aches from last night's libation
But much more from the sight of notation
You wield that big O like no one I know
As we dance to the algorithms tango
Let the math obfuscate, not enlighten;
Use new symbols in order to frighten.
Dash through a proof mere mortals would goof
As we dance to the algorithms tango
